    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Joshe Jade Theys, an aspiring Junior Developer. I am currently completing a course in Web Development and Programming. I am a very creative person with a passion for the Arts. You can find me writing poetry over the weekends. As a result of my creative mind I am able to solve problems in innovative ways. I am capable leader and undertook a Leadership course at Stellenbosch University. As part of the curriculum I learned how to be a leader who is respectful of diversity in the work place and one who can find the best way to address problems. 
        I undertook training to become a peer counselor where I learned how to be empathetic and how to effectively communicate with others. I undertook a First Aid Course in 2020 where I learned how to act under high pressure environments and how to keep a group calm.  
        I believe that I will be able to use the life experience and skills I have learned to become a valuable asset to the workplace.
